# PythonProjects

From development side I started learning Python from Udemy and did a couple of small challenges for 
practicing like made a Blackjack game using TKinter and all.
Recently I tried to learn Selenium from YouTube and tried to make a basic WhatsApp bot.
Also i made a basic GUI project "Typing Increaser" from the topics I have learned so far.
